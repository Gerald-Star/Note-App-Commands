3. Creating an abstraction to CRUD the notes
   CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Read
   CRUD operations refer to the basic functions that can be performed on the notes in the database.

- **Create**: This operation involves adding a new note to the database. It can be done by providing the necessary information about the note, such as its title, content, and any relevant tags.
- **Read**: This operation involves retrieving an existing note from the database. It can be done by searching for the note by its title, content, or tags.
- **Update**: This operation involves modifying an existing note in the database. It can be done by changing the values of the note's attributes, such as its title, content, or tags.
- **Delete**: This operation involves removing an existing note from the database. It can be done by searching for the note by its title, content, or tags, and then deleting it.

By using these CRUD operations, users can easily manage their notes in the JSON file database.

{
  "name": "note",
  "bin": {
    "note": "./index.js"
  }
}

set this on top of your script
#!/usr/bin/env node

- run note to start your CLI
